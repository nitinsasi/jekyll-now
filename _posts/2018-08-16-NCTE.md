New Delhi, Aug 16 ; The National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) today celebrated its 23rd foundation day as it moved to a new campus.

Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, who was to inaugurate the new building, could not attend the event due to critical health condition of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who died at the hospital at 05-05 pm.

Rina Ray, School Education Secretary, HRD Ministry, spoke about the bill which was recently introduced in Rajya Sabha to provide retrospective recognition to central and state government funded institutions offering B.Ed and related courses which are not recognised under NCTE Act.
