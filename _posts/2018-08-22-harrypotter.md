Entering the married celebs bandwagon is another Harry Potter actress. Congratulations are in order for Padma Patil, you guys! Remember the Bangladeshi-origin girl who accompanied Ron Weasley for the Yule Ball in Harry Potter & The Goblet Of Fire? 

Afshan Azad tied the knot with her soulmate Nabil Kazi last week! As if the fairytale wedding wasn’t enough, the highlight was the mini Harry Potter reunion.


The lovely couple had a traditional Bangladeshi wedding last week and then hosted a reception for their friends and family.


Posting a photo from the wedding last week, Afshan she wrote; “Incredibly blessed. After a year of planning on my own, the tears and tantrums, today was an absolute dream. Married and moved out of Manchester to start my new life. Thank you to my incredible family and friends, without you I’m nothing. Best wedding ever, even if I do say so myself! Keep us in your prayers. #KazadWedding #RoyalWedding”
