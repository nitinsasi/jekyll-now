MUMBAI  Actress Kangana Ranaut and self-proclaimed controversial godman Sadhguru faces condemnation for justifying mob lynching in the name of the cow.

The actress interacting with the spiritual leader during ‘In Conversation with the Mystic 2018’ earlier this week slamming India’s liberal class and justifying the mob lynching.

As expected, after the video of their chat went viral, it triggered a debate on social media. Here is how Twitter reacted


At one place, Kangana, in her conversation with Sadhguruis heard saying, “I’m working on a martyr’s biopic Manikarnika where there is a scene where my protagonist, Laxmi Bai, goes and saves a calf. My crew had a discussion, we halted the shoot. They said ‘we can’t save a calf’ because we don’t want to look like cow savers.”

She then goes on to add, “When such a prejudice thrives, as a person you feel very protective of who you are and what your values are, and you want to save all animals and you definitely want to save the cows because the prejudice is really agonizing. But (then) lynching for cows takes place and you look like an idiot. You feel conflicted. You want to save the animals but when the lynching happens, you feel heartbroken at what’s going on. You feel this is wrong.”

Sadhguru, while talking about lynching in India, says, “I am saying that these people, who are talking about lynchings, they’ve not seen India at all.” He was referring to the justification for violence in the name of cattle in the Holy books of Hinduism.
