WhatsApp has had a pretty solid 2018 in terms of updates, but it isn’t stopping yet. According to the ever-reliable WABetaInfo, the messaging platform is getting ready to launch picture-in-picture videos on Android.The feature, which first landed on iOS back in May, will reportedly allow users to play videos from YouTube and Instagram in a small window within the chat app itself. In other words, you won’t have to hop into YouTube’s or Instagram’s apps to quickly view a clip sent by a contact. However, the outlet adds that the new feature isn’t compatible with Instagram Stories, so you’ll still need to launch the Instagram app for those.

To actually activate picture-in-picture mode, you’ll need to tap on the play icon that appears in sent video links 
Picture-in-picture videos don’t seem to be available for us (I’m in the beta program and just updated to version 2.18.234), but we expect the feature to slowly roll out to users in the coming weeks.

This would be the latest feature to come to WhatsApp in 2018, joining group calls, suspicious link detection, and more admin controls. What would you like to see in WhatsApp though? Let us know in the comments!
