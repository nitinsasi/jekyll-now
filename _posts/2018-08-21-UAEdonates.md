Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced today that the UAE has offered assistance   to aid relief efforts in the state ravaged worst monsoon in close to a century.

Vijayan informed the media about the UAE's overture and thanked them for their "timely" help. "Today morning, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, informed our Prime Minister about their contribution for Kerala and this was conveyed to me by M.A. Yusuf Ali (who owns Lulu Supermarkets)," he said. "The Kerala diaspora has been a huge source of help for us. Since they have done tremendous service in the Middle East, it has helped build good relations with the governments there."

"We also express the gratitude of Kerala to HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and the Emir of Abu Dhabi, and HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister of UAE and Emir of Dubai," tweeted Vijayan.

Depending on whom you ask, 6-8 lakh people are stuck in 3,000-5,000 relief camps set up across the rain-battered state. The death toll has crossed 300 and the Chief Minister recently pegged the overall damage caused in the state at over Rs 19,500 crore. That's just the initial assessment.

Last week, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and the vice president of the UAE, took to Twitter to announce the formation of a committee to extend emergency help to the state. "UAE and the Indian community will unite to offer relief to those affected. We have formed a committee to start immediately. We urge everyone to contribute generously towards this initiative," he tweeted. 

Vijayan said they would ask the Centre to allow Kerala to increase the market borrowings from 3 per cent of the state's total revenue to 4.5 per cent. As a result an additional Rs 10,000 crore can be raised.

"We have decided to approach agencies like NABARD whose mandate includes providing for infrastructure and drinking water.

"We will demand a special package for the state," said Vijayan.

Following the devastating floods, over one million people are now sheltered in 3,274 relief camps in the state. The death toll since the monsoon rains began on May 29 has been estimated at around 370.

Till Monday, the total contributions received to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund was Rs 210 crore while another Rs 160 crore has been pledged.
