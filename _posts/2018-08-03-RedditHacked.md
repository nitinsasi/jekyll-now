title:  Reddit hacked, despite SMS two-factor authentication
categories: tech
---

Reddit on Wednesday reported a data breach. The good news? Nothing too major was likely stolen. The bad news? It involved a two-factor authentication scam.

During the mid-June intrusion, the hacker accessed an old backup of Reddit that contained user data such as hashed passwords from 2007. The culprit also viewed logs from Reddit's "email digests," which can associate a username with an email address, if you provided it.

In other words, the breach appears to have only exposed email address information for existing users and scrambled password data for long-time Reddit fans from over a decade ago.

"The attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs," Reddit engineer " KeyserSosa " said in a post detailing the security incident.
