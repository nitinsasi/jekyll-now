Flipkart has launched a new e-commerce portal for refurbished products. Called '2GUDâ€™, the platform is initially selling smartphones, laptops and electronic accessories, but plans are afoot to add speakers, power banks, TV sets and other large appliances. The goods, which will come with a warranty of 3-12 months, are likely to be sold for 50-80% of the original price. Through the initiative, Flipkart is eyeing a pie of a growing refurbished goods market that's expected to hit $20 billion in 5-6 years. Earlier this week, the e-tailer announced it had bought AI startup Liv.ai to boost conversational shopping in regional languages.
