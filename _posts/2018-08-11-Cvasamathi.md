MUMBAI- In 2015, C Vanmathi made news after she, the daughter of a cab driver, cleared the UPSC final exam. On Monday afternoon (August 6), the young IAS officer was in the news for a different reason. An assistant collector and project office of the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) in Nandurbar, she found herself in a frightening situation as some angry representatives of tribal students began vandalising her car, while she was still inside. Rescued by police officers, Vanmathi escaped unhurt but the incident was disturbing enough for the IAS Association to take up the issue as it sought ‘strict action’ against the culprits. The association tweeted that it wants the government to take first steps towards ‘protecting its officers on field duty’.

Several bureaucrats posted in Maharashtra said that Vanmathi’s case is not an isolated one and attacks have become a norm. They also said that the state needs to have ‘zero tolerance’ on this issue as officers cannot work in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.

In 2010, Naval Kishore Ram, then a young IAS probationer and CEO of Kinvat Nagar Parishad in Nanded, was inquiring a case of encroachment in the city. He was attacked by an angry mob, which entered his office and hit him with iron rods and stones. A badly injured Ram was saved by his office superintendent, who whisked him away. He had to spend two weeks in a hospital. It was only last year that the Nanded court sentenced accused persons to two years of imprisonment.

“There should be no compromise with our safety; we have to ensure that officers should never be afraid of taking the right decision,” said Ram.
