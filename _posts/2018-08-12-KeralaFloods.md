The Kerala floods appear to have dampened the Onam spirit, with shopkeepers praying for sunnier days that would encourage customers to spend big to celebrate the state's topmost festival.

There's a dip in Onam sales because of the water logging.

Onam falls on August 25 but the celebrations begin 10 days earlier. In normal years, the sales tend to pick up at least 10 days before the celebrations start, Satheendran said. "But that isn't happening this year."

People clean their houses, apply rice flour batter on the main entrance (a traditional welcome sign), take an early bath, wear new clothes and distribute alms to needy.

The eldest female member of each family presents clothes to all the members of the family.

Most cities in Kerala are lit up with lights and fabulous displays of fireworks. Sumptuous Onam Sadya feasts are prepared.

The afternoon is marked with various traditional Onam games normally seen in rural areas and are organized by resident associations, clubs etc. in large cities.

In some parts of Kerala, people indulge in various games and dances (Onakkalikal) during and post Thiruvonam. These include Thiruvathirakali, Kummattikali, Pulikali etc.
