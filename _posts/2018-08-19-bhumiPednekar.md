Bhumi was born on 18th July, 1989, in Mumbai to a Maharashtrian Father and a Harayanvi Mother. She also has a younger sister Samiksha, who is in legal profession.
Bhumi Pednekar did her schooling from Arya Vidya Mandir School in Juhu, Mumbai. She was a decent student in her school days. When she told her mother that she wanted to be an actress, her parents got her enrolled in Subash Ghai's acting school Whistling Woods for a year. She was only of 16 years at the time. Bhumi pednekar still pursued her graduation in commerce via correspondence because her parents wanted her to have a stable back up option.

During this time, a friend informed her that Yash raj films was on the lookout for an assistant casting director. So, she applied for the job and got it.  Her first boss was Abhimanyu Ray. Bhumi Pednekar assisted him in casting for films like Chak De! India, Rocket Singh: Salesman Of The Year and Teen Patti. Later she joined casting director Shanoo Sharma after assisting Abhimanyu Ray for some time. Bhumi used to send a reference audition to those actors who came from outside Mumbai. 
For her role in Dam laga ke haisha, she did a mock audition and didn't realise that it was her first audition for the movie. She ended up auditioning for the movie for the next two months and ultimately bagged the part. Bhumi had to gain 12 kilogram for the character. She played the role of Sandhya Varma in her debut film in 2015. It is also reported that Pednekar has signed a three-film deal with Yash Raj Films.
The first thing she did on receiving her first pay as an actress was to gift her younger sister, a term in Jindal Global Law School. Bhumi Pednekar also appeared in Y-Films's mini web-series Man's world. 
And now she is working with Akshay Kumar in Shree Narayan Singh's directorial debut Toilet-Ek Prem Katha which is generating a lot of buzz. Bhumi Pednekar will also be seen in a movie with Ayushmann Khurrana, who was her first co-star. We wish her all the best for all her future projects.
Before becoming an actress, Bhumi Pednekar was an assistant to Shanoo Sharma, the casting director of Yash Raj films for six years. 
For her first role in movies, she had no idea that she was actually auditioning for the role. She thought her performance would be used as demo to brief other actors during auditions.
Bhumi Pednekar won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her film Dum Laga Ke Haisha.
She also appeared in Y-Films's mini web-series Man's world. The series also featured actresses like Parineeti Chopra, Kalki Koechlin and Richa Chadda.
