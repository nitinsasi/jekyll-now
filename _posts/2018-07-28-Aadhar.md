title: Aadhar to run campaigns to “neutralise” the “negative sentiments” on the social media. 
---
The Unique Identification Authority of India, which manages the Aadhaar database of more than one billion Indians, not only wants to monitor the coverage of Aadhaar in the news media, it also wants to trawl through social media conversations to gauge sentiments about the biometrics-based 12-digit identification number. It hopes to use this information to identify “detractors” and “influencers” and run campaigns to “neutralise” the “negative sentiments” on the social media.

The Authority issued a bid document on July 18, seeking to hire a social media agency that will employ “online reputation management” and “social listening” tools to monitor and influence conversations related to Aadhaar on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This is separate from the bid document issued on July 19 to hire a media monitoring agency, which will track all national and regional newspapers, news channels and websites for Aadhaar-related coverage, as reported in Business Standard on Friday.
