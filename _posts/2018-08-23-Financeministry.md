The finance ministry has rejected a ₹30,000 crore fund infusion for Air India for want of a concrete turnaround plan. It has instead asked the carrier to transfer its non-core assets and unsustainable debt to a special purpose vehicle, so that they can be monetised to repay loans. Air India has a total debt of nearly ₹49,000 crore, of which around ₹22,000 crore can't be serviced with its cash flows. Earlier, Economic Times reported that the Maharajah was likely to receive another bailout package after the government’s partial divestment move failed to find any takers.
