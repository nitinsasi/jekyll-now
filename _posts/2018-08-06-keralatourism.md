KERALA is known as "God's Own Country". It is the tourism wonder-child of India. No other State has high mountains so close to the sea, or such a symbiotic relationship between many faiths and ethnic groups, or be its unique back waters. Also long years of Communism had created an eclectic mix of an enviable quality of life and a strong co-operative movement

The  following are the eternal part of Kerala which makes the state unique and also leads to its name of God's Own..

1. Climate ; People might call the weather tropical but they are missing the best part. The MONSOONS.  It's a different fact that the drainage gets clogged and other water redirection problems but the sight of the rain gods blessing the place for a good 2 to 3 months is something people should experience.

2. People ; The people of Kerala are very much different from those residing in other parts of the country. They possess the perfect mix of " How are you? " and "I don't give a fuck ". This is very rare to find. 

3. Food  ; The food in every part of Kerala is unique and awesome. From seafood to sadyas, every part of the state have their own delicacy to treat the taste buds from varying veg dishes like aviyal, thiyal etc to the non veg beef fry , fish fry or the malabar biryani!





4.Coconut here, coconut there, coconut everywhere ; The amount of coconut that the state use be it in the delicacies or the oil - be it for cooking or as hair oil. We love our coconuts. It might possibly be the highest density of these trees on earth. And how many people have died from coconut related injuries. Surely, someone walking down the village path would have a coconut fall on his head. At least once, I would imagine. There are actually no reported numbers on coconut related deaths

5. Gold; How much gold is “really” there in Kerala is anybody’s guess. Combined with the Padmanabhaswamy temple and every Kerala household, I am thinking it might possibly be the richest state in the country.

6.Land of heaviest drinkers? Enroute, few of us were talking outside the bus, in the morning about to board, we noticed a seemingly inebriated guy who was just barely able to stand, hanging around our bus. I’m not about to disapprove of his drinking habit (it’s his choice ),  and early in the day. But at 8 am? Fully drunk? What time would he have started?

Someone else has pondered on this heavy issue and this BBC article has facts and personal accounts that might give an insight. “Kerala is India’s tippler country. It has the highest per capita consumption – over eight litres (1.76 gallons) per person a year – in the nation, overtaking traditionally hard-drinking states like Punjab and Haryana. The curiously-named Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) runs 337 liquor shops, open seven days a week. Each shop caters on average to an astonishing 80,000 clients.

But alas; The Kerala State government has introduced prohibition in a phased manner. Liquor would now be sold in 5 Star hotels only and Toddy will still be sold as before .

·         7. Kerala is the first state in India to reach 100% literacy rate.

8. Female to male sex ratio is highest in India

9. Kerala is a state where you can see elephants on the road. Elephants are entwined with Kerala’s culture from ancient times. No other place would you have 30 elephants standing amongst hundreds of drummers standing amongst thousands of people.You will find this at Thrissur Pooram Koddamattam – famous temple festival.




Apart from this it is known for its boat races, back waters, ayurvedic treatments. Truly varying in experience be it place or people ; Truly gods own country!
