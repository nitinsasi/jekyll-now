Facebook is all set to take on mobile dating apps like Tinder and TrulyMadly. Two months after announcing the product, Facebook has now finally begun testing its dating project internally with employees.

First reported by The Verge, an independent app researcher Jane Manchun Wong found evidence of the dating feature testing and posted it on Twitter. 
"This product is for US Facebook employees who have opted-in to dogfooding Facebook's new dating product."

"The purpose for this dogfooding is to test the end-to-end product experience for bugs and confusing UI (user interface). This is not meant for dating your co-workers," reads the screenshot. The company has confirmed that the feature is being tested internally and is confidential.

"Dogfooding this product is completely voluntary and has no impact on your employment," the screenshot reads further. Facebook has also confirmed that the feature is being tested within the main Facebook app.
