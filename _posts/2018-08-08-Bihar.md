Biharâ€™s social welfare minister Manju Verma finally resigned on Wednesday under relentless pressure to take moral responsibility for the the Muzzafarpur case and her husband's alleged links to the main accused, Brajesh Thakur.  She handed over her resignation to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who just two days back had said the Minister will have to go if any wrongdoing is proved on her part in the CBI probe but seemed reluctant to make her resign immediately.
