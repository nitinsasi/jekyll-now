WhatsApp will trace the origin of fake messages circulated on the platform. IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said WhatsApp CEO Chris Daniels assured him of "working out a technological solution" to locate the source of fake messages and complying with RBI rules on local storage of financial data (for its payments service). Besides, the government asked the Facebook-owned messaging app to appoint a local grievance officer and register a corporate entity in the country. WhatsApp had earlier expressed its inability to trace messages saying that would mean decryption, thereby amounting to violation of privacy.
