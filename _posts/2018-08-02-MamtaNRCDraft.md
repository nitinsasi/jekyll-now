A police complaint was lodged against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee by a youth leader in Lakhimpur on August 1 over her remarks on Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) draft.

Sudipta Hazarika, general secretary of the central committee of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Parishad, filed the complaint at the North Lakhimpur Sadar police station over Ms. Banerjee’s remarks on July 31 that the NRC in Assam could lead to a “bloodbath and a civil war in the country”, the police said.

After the publication of draft NRC on Monday, the West Bengal CM had warned of a “civil war”. She had alleged that NRC was an exercise against Bengalis and Biharis.

Meanwhile, a Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation, comprising MPs and MLAs, will visit Assam’s Barak Valley on Thursday to take stock of the situation.
