India’s largest e-commerce firm Flipkart is making a second attempt at a customer loyalty programme to take on Amazon’s Prime subscription service that contributes more than a third of the retail giant’s gross sales in the country.

Flipkart Plus, which goes live on Aug. 15, will be free, it said in a statement. Amazon charges its Prime subscribers a monthly and annual fees and bundles in all offerings under one roof.

Flipkart, which agreed to sell a majority stake to Walmart Inc in May, will instead offer digital currency, called Plus Coins, that customers will earn on every purchase. The coins can be redeemed to join the programme, helping customers get more discounts, early access to sale events, and free and faster product delivery. Besides, they can also be used on platforms like Hotstar, Zomato, and MakeMyTrip, among others.

Amazon Prime, launched in 2016, accounts for 35 percent of all orders on Amazon India, increasing its market share in India. It helped the Seattle-based giant beat Flipkart in user experience, Redseer consulting had said in its November report.
