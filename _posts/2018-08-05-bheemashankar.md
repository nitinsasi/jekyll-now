In this context, it is really shocking that a SEX MMS has become viral of this IPS officer.

SEX MMS Scandal of Bheemashankar
An engineer based in Davangere named Suresh has filed police complaint alleging that Bheemashankar has forced to make sexual relationship with his wife.

Bheema met Rupa when he was the SP of Davangere in her studio. Bheema had gone there for a photoshot with his two little daughters. He got attracted towards Rupa and somehow managed to make relationship with her.

The video which has gone viral has been shot by none other than Bheemashankar himself.

A Case of Consensual Sex?
There is no denying that this may be a case of consensual case. As can be seen in the video, Rupa is willingly allowing Bheema to kiss her. She has also no problem with Bheema getting the act by his mobile phone.
