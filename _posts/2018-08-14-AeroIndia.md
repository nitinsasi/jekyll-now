As and when the announcement comes, it will be the first time since its inception in 1996 that the Aero India show will fly out of Bengaluru.

The Karnataka government has questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre over the decision to shift the 22nd edition of Aero India show from Bengaluru to Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow.

Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA government, Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy asserted that Bengaluru was the proper place for Aero India show, pointing that the Karnataka capital had all infrastructure needed.

Speaking to mediapersons on Sunday, the Janata Dal Secular (JDS) leader said, “Our BJP friends in Karnataka must answer. We also requested the defence minister and told her that Bengaluru is the proper place for the Aero show event and we have all infrastructure in place as well. I don’t know why the Centre took such a decision.”
 
 According to the force, there were two reasons for its apprehension. First, the infrastructure needed to host an event of this scale has been created at Yelahanka over the years and the sudden decision to move out would require preparations on a war footing.

Second, the air force argued that Bakshi Ka Talab, which the ministry of defence is keen on, is highly unsuitable as the runway is under repair, the approach road from Lucknow is a “nightmare” and there is no place to house so many aircraft and vendors.

> Kumaraswamy has tweeted - There is mounting pressure from all over the country against reported shifting of #AeroIndia from Bengaluru. #AeroIndia is a part of Brand Bengaluru.  I request central govt to desist from making any such move.
