On #IndependenceDay, London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has returned India a 12th century statue of Lord Buddha stolen from India 57 years ago. The Buddha statue was one of 14 statues stolen from a museum in Nalanda, eastern India in 1961 and later surfaced at a London trade fair. 

Police in London handed over the bronze statue with silver inlay during a ceremony on Wednesday marking India's Independence Day. 

Police were called after representatives from the association for Research into Crimes Against Art and the India Pride Project noticed the statue at a trade fair. 

Upon learning the item had been stolen, the dealer and owner agreed to return it. 

It was officially handed over on Wednesday to the Indian High Commissioner to the UK during a ceremony to mark Independence Day.
