 We are collectively being faced with more external pressures in the modern world. The pace of work is increasing and we are asked to do more work in less time. If we are not careful in living an orderly life, our stress levels can skyrocket and leave us rattled with anxiety, anger, frustration, and other negative emotions. 
 
 A lot of things get you stressed throughout the day; a call from your boss, an annoying co worker, the never ending to do list, pending works and so on.
Meditation will not only help you handle work pressure but also turn stress into success. It will help you to stay motivated and productive.
 
 
 Luckily there are many ways to deal with stress constructively. While we may not have full control over the external environment, we can slowly gain mastery over the internal environment, or the mind. There are many ways to train the mind, and all of them have to do with regulating our thoughts. Here are two practical ways to train your mind and regulate your thoughts at work to lower stress and anxiety. 
 
 
 Give others the benefit of the doubt-People might say rude or insensitive things to you while also placing heavy work demands on you. Instead of getting angry, remain aware that they probably had no intention to be mean to you. That may be how they communicate, they may also be under a lot of pressure, and they might not be aware of what your schedule is like. Give others the benefit of the doubt with respect to their intentions, while also being clear and firm about your needs and capacity to take on work. 
 
 
 Actively generate positive emotions-Positive emotions such as gratitude, love, joy, etc. harmonise the mind, which can help you manage and complete your work more effectively. We can actively generate positive emotions from within ourselves. Think of all the things in your life you are grateful for. Think of those things that make you feel love, happiness, joy, etc. and really feel those positive emotions and let them wash over you. Make a habit of remaining in a positive emotional state even when there is chaos around you. 
 
 
You’re feeling good, aren’t you? Ready to take on the world! Regular meditation leads to a massive reduction in stress levels. And this won’t be just a temporary reaction. Any unnecessary fight or flight response will simply disappear. You will lead a calmer, more balanced life – naturally.

“Meditation is the way to take deep rest and be alert and conscious at the same time! It is the skill to calm the mind and get in touch with your inner joy.” Sri Sri Ravi Shankar

 The mind is efficiency obsessed, and therefore, it is difficult to re-orient it from patterns of negative thinking. It is useful to take up an effective meditation system to work on reconstructing our minds
