Tech Mahindra launched a new Facial Recognition Attendance System for employees under the TechMNxt charter. This initiative is in line with Tech Mahindra’s promise to FUTURise internally, and give employees a connected and seamless experience of the workplace of the future, by leveraging next-generation technologies like Artificial Intelligence

The new attendance system will give employees the freedom of attendance through facial recognition, thereby eliminating the need of the traditional identification cards and other tedious login processes. Besides registering attendance, the facial recognition system comes equipped with a Moodometer which will also help gauge the overall sentiment of the organization through the collective facial expressions captured.
The system can recognise nine different facial expressions. It captures the expression on the face of the employees every time he or she uses the system and consolidates the information from all employees daily to create a moodometer score, which reflects the mood of the workforce.
