Calcutta: The state government on Monday transferred seven senior IAS officers, a move considered to be the last major change in the bureaucracy before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Rajiva Sinha, a 1986 batch IAS officer who was secretary in charge of the micro, small and medium enterprises department, has been transferred to the health department. Transport secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, a 1987 batch officer, replaces Sinha.

"Sinha and Bandyopadhyay are two of the senior-most officers in Bengal now. They have been given bigger responsibilities. While Sinha will have to streamline the health department, which was at the centre of controversies over the past few weeks, Bandyopadhyay will have to organise the conclave of micro, small and medium enterprises, to be held later this year," an official at Nabanna said.

Animal resources development secretary B.P. Gopalika, a 1989 batch officer, is the new transport secretary. Verma, also a 1989 batch officer, replaces Gopalika.
