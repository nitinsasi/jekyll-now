The elevation of Uttarakhand Chief Justice KM Joseph as Supreme Court judge hit the headlines hard yesterday. What missed the spotlight a little was that along with Justice Joseph, Madras High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Orissa High Court Chief Justice Vineet Saran were also elevated as Supreme Court judges.

Among the three, it is Justice Indira Banerjee who made a new record for India with her elevation. For the first time since it was established in 1950, the Supreme Court of India will have three women judges at the same time now.

Here are a few things you must know about Justice Banerjee-

Born on September 24, 1957, Indira Banerjee did her schooling at the well-known Loreto House in Kolkata. From there, she went on pursue the Bachelor's degree at the Presidency College, and then to Calcutta University for further studies in law.
She started practicing law as an advocate at Calcutta High in July
1985.
She was appointed as a permanent Judge of Calcutta High Court on February 5, 2002.
In August 2016, she was transferred to Delhi High Court.
She was then elevated as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court in April 2017, succeeding Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.
Justice Banerjee, 60, is the second woman to head the chartered High Court, after Justice Kanta Kumari Bhatnagar.
On July 16, the Supreme Court Collegium recommended Justice Banerjee's name for elevation to Supreme Court, which was accepted by the Centre yesterday.
With her elevation, Justice Banerjee becomes the eighth woman judge the Supreme Court has ever had.
She also makes a new record. With Justice R Banumathi and Justice Indu Malhotra already at the Supreme Court, Justice Indira Banerjee's elevation takes the number of women judges at Supreme Court at point point to three, a number that has never been achieved since its inception in 1950.
