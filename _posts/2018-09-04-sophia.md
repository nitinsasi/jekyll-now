A woman has been arrested in the southern state of Tamil Nadu for calling India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) "fascist".Sofia Lois made the remark when she saw BJP politician Tamilisai Soundararajan, who then filed a police complaint.The incident occurred on Monday at an airport in the state and a video of the two women arguing soon went viral.

Ms Lois was released on bail on Tuesday.The arrest of Sofia Lois has prompted outrage. 


This incident ignites a question about India's Prime minister Modi's tweet back from April 18, in which he tweeted that Government should accept criticism. The appeal has gone waste
with Sofia's case.
