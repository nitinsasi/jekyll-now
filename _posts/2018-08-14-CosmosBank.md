PUNE ; Hackers managed to siphon off over Rs 94 crore through a malware attack on the server of Pune-based Cosmos Bank and cloning thousands of the bank's debit cards over a period of two days, a top official said.

The fraudulent transactions were carried out on August 11 and August 13 and the malware attack by the hackers originated in Canada, Cosmos Bank chairman Milind Kale told reporters here today.

"In two days, hackers withdrew a total Rs 78 crore from various ATMs in 28 countries, including Canada, Hong Kong and a few ATMs in India, and another Rs 2.5 crore were taken out within India," he said.

On August 13, hackers again transferred Rs 13.92 crore in a Hong Kong-based bank by using fraudulent transactions.

He said the malware attack was on the switch, which is operative for payment gateways of Visa and Rupay debit cards.
