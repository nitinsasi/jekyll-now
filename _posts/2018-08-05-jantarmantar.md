Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Friday, 4 August joined the protests held by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against the heinous mass rape in Muzaffarpur.

This is the first time that Opposition leaders including AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal, Left’s D Raja and Sitaram Yechury, former JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav and TMC’s Dinesh Trivedi along with the Congress President shared the same platform to protest.

While addressing the mass gathering in the national capital, Rahul Gandhi said, "We are here to stand with the women of the country. There is a rise in attacks on the weaker sections of the society."
