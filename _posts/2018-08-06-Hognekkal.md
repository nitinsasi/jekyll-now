Hogenakkal falls is around 170Kms from Bangalore towards E-city and then Hosur road. It takes around 4.5 hrs to reach because of traffic in the Hosur road toll. Once reaching the spot, we have to collect the tickets of coracle ride.The place of falls cannot be seen from the place on land so u have to take a boat called 'theppa' they will cost you depending on the season and they will take you to the falls they will show u around 10 falls with a very risky distance the water there is very deep with lots of vertex. So be careful not for light hearted!   It costs around INR 750/- for 1 coracle and it can take 4 people with a maximum weight of 350Kgs.  Some coracle charge INR 300 per ride for just a 5 minute ride. The boatsmen are always right behind you to take you for a ride, literally and figuratively.



Other perspective is the human presence and activities that have almost destroyed the sheer purpose for which one likes to go to such places. The sight of men for an oil massage and bath in the falls is just an eyesore. Hogenakkal has become the Tirupati of waterfalls and this is mostly on weekends. Don't forget to have a fried fish . Its fresh and very tasty
