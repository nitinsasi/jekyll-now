There are already too many messaging apps like Google Allo, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Telegram, Hike, WeChat, Line in market, In addition to that Swai Ramdev has also 
launched a messaging app called Kimbho. Orkut owner has also launched a messaging last month named 'Hello' , however these apps have their own pros and cons and users prefer to have 1-2 of them and not all. We have recently seen that Allo and Hello was not a successful venture. The Indian Market is governed by facebook messenger and whats app. 

To mark India's 72nd Independence Day, Baba Ramdev-owned Patanjali 're-launched' its instant messaging app — also dubbed as a desi version of WhatsApp — Kimbho. The app was earlier introduced on May 30 this year and was available for download on both iOS and Android platforms but was removed within days. The company had claimed that the app was released for a one-day trial and would be back on app stores officially very soon after technical development phase was over.
As it appears, the app has been re-launched on Independence Day. In an SMS, Patanjali said that the official launch will take place on August 27, 2018 but the app can be downloaded from Google Play Store. "Happy Independence Day. Celebrate this Independence Day as Digital Independence with "Kimbho". The official launch of the app is on 27th August, 2018. We welcome your comments & suggestions. Bharat Mata Ki Jai..!" the message read and also included a link to Google Play Store.

> When the app was first launched, a French security researcher, who tweets under pseudonym Elliot Alderson, had called it a ‘security disaster’. “This KimbhoApp is a joke, next time before making press statements, hire competent developers… If it is not clear, for the moment don’t install this app,” Anderson had tweeted.
