The [Ministry of Finance](http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183182) issued a press release on August 31 to clarify that the rumours circulating are baseless.


Banks will only observe holidays on Sunday, 2nd September and second Saturday, 8th September ; Monday, 3rd September is not a pan India holiday 

ATMs in all States will be fully functional; Banks advised to ensure availability of sufficient cash for dispensation from ATMs 

It has come to notice that a rumour is circulating in several sections of the social media that banks will be closed for 6 days in the first week of September 2018, causing undue panic among the general public.

It is hereby clarified that banks will remain open and banking activity will continue unimpeded in the first week of September. Banks will only observe holidays on Sunday, 2nd September and second Saturday, 8th September. Monday, 3rd September is not a pan India holiday and banks only in some States where a holiday is declared under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 will remain closed.

Even on those days, ATMs in all States will be fully functional and there will be no impact on online banking transactions. Banks have been advised to ensure that sufficient cash is available for dispensation from ATMs. Banks will remain open on all other days.
