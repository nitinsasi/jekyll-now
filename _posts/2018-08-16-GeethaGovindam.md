Geetha Govindam takes its time to establish how the good hero is perceived as a pervert by Geetha (Rashmika Mandanna) during a bus journey. Vijay makes a wrong move egged on by his friend Ramakrishna (a hilarious Rahul Ramakrishna, playing the kind of friend whose advice you should never listen to), and rightfully gets slapped. Though she doesn’t shout and stop the bus, she calls her brother (Subbaraju) and asks him to arrive at the bus destination. Vijay escapes, only to come face-to-face with Geetha again later, as her brother is the one engaged to his sister.

The rest of the film follows the journey of Vijay and Geetha. Since Vijay is the hero, he gets a chance to redeem himself. Geetha and Vijay are also thrown into situations where they have to get together for the wedding preparations.

Vijay Deverakonda's film  Geetha Govindam, co-starring Rashmika Mandanna  is released on  August 15  at Farzi Café, Hyderabad. The youth icon kicked in the day in his own style by celebrating it with school children at the café on Wednesday. He could be seen playing with the kids and showering them with hugs.
Nearly 50 school students took part in the festivities. Looks like Deverakonda felt nothing but love on this day, seeing as how his movie kicked off with positive talk too!
