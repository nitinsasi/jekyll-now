  Manju Verma is the former cabinet minister of Bihar. She was once considered a close confidante to Nitish Kumar. However, the sordid incident of Muzaffarpur where more than 30 girls were raped led to her resignation. Her department was seen as giving fund to the prime accused Brajesh Thakur without going through details. Her husband is also accused to be close to the moron Thakur.

Kumari Manju Verma represents Cheria – Baliarpur constituency. She is a two times MLA, and at both occasions, she defeated LJP candidate and former MLA Anil Kumar Mahto. This constituency has also been represented by her father – in – law Sukhdeo Mahto in 1980. So, it can be said that she got advantage because of political pedigree when it comes to getting ticket. However, only political pedigree can’t fetch you votes. In 2010, her winning margin was little over 1000 votes. In 2015, she won handsomely with more than 29,000 votes. The new equation of grand alliance was not the only reason behind this astronomical rise in the winning margin. The reason is also increasing popularity of Manju Verma in Cheria – Baliarpur on the back of her social contact and endeavor to bring development projects to the area.

Bio and Wiki of Manju Verma
Manju was born in 1969 in Samastipur district. She has completed Matriculation from R. H. High School, Alouli (Khagaria) in 1976 and I. Sc. from V. R. V. College, Samastipur. Just after I. Sc., she got married and quit education. She started to get interest in politics post 2005 Bihar election. After a short stint with RJD, she joined JDU. In no time, she came close to many JDU leaders like Bogo Singh in Begusarai. Eventually, she got ticket in 2010 Assembly election and rest is history.

Husband of Manju Verma
The husband of Manu Verma is Chandrashekhar Verma. Mr. Verma was seen having close relationship to Brajesh Thakur. It is a fact that he is the son of a former MLA and the husband of a cabinet minister, yet even people of Cheria – Bariarpur have very little information about him.

Caste of Manju Verma

Manju Verma belongs to OBC caste Koeri (or, Kushwaha). The projection of Manju Verma by Nitish Kumar was done because of this caste factor. He wanted to keep Koeri votes with him which was getting away because of revolt of Upendra Kushwaha and Shakuni Chaudhary.
