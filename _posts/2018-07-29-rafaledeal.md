title: Will the Rafale coffer prove costly for Modi?
---

Bofors scandal amount was somewhere around 64 crore and Rafale is about 35000 crore, you can make out the volume by these figures

A deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets has the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress at loggerheads. Congress President Rahul Gandhi has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not being truthful about the deal, demanding the government reveal the price it paid for the aircraft.

We look at claims made by the BJP and the Congress in the Rafale aircraft deal and fact check them. The lack of transparency in Defense deal has fired a political storm. UPA government floated a tender and many companies participated and found that Dassault Rafale, a France company who make Rafale has the least quote. The cost of one jet was coming out to be 600 crore and Hindustan Aeronautical was selcted to assemble the jets in India . Dassault Rafale also agreed to transfer the technology so going forward it can be made in India only.

In 2014 new govt. was formed in India , On 25th  March 2015 Dassault Rafale company CEO then visited India and made a press conference and confirms that Rafale plane will be made in India. Same day two new companies gets registered one by Adani and other one by Ambani.On, 3rd of April Parelkar who was then Defense minister was called by PM and informed that PM is visiting France for a defense deal. It was surprising that at that time Army and Defense minister was not informed about PM’s decision. On 8th April , Foreign Secretary Jayashankar called a press conference and said that the old Rafale deal is progressing. 10th April PM Modi gives a bear hug to the PM of France and signs 17 new MOU’s , One of the MOU’s stated that a new Rafale deal will be done with India for 36 Jets. Same day a dinner was hosted at France PM’s residence where Gautam Adani and Anil Ambani was also present.

The deal on Oct 2016 was formulated and came in media that 36 jet will be purchased for a cost of 58, 000 crore. The half of the amount will be paid to Anil Ambani’s company for manufacturing the parts of these jets. Anil Ambani’s company who never made any Jets replaced Hindustan Aeronautical in the deals.The air force is desperate for fighters, sure. But it is not desperate for these fighters, it desperate for a particular kind of fighter that you can buy cheaply, in large numbers, put in place the infrastructure, operate them economically in the way that good defense planners do. India already has two jet aircraft for nuclear delivery one is Jaguar and other one is Mirage.Both these aircrafts are being now upgraded so that their lifespan go beyond 2030. SO we have a zero need for a nuclear delivery aircraft at this point of time. The argument which Defence Minister is giving to justify the deal does not stand in front of any serious investigation. Aircraft for Nuclear delivery is most vulnerable and the least desirable option. We have ballistic missile and submarine launch capability for nuclear launch and aircraft for nuclear delivery is the last option.

Surprisingly the knowledge transfer about manufacturing the Rafale Jets inhouse within India was also removed from the new MOU. Nirmala Sitharaman who is the current Defence Minister denied all these allegations and said that there is a secret pact between two countries during the UPA tenure. The interesting fact is that the agreement which Defence Minister was pointing actually ended on Jan 2018.

The NDA government is purchasing it for 1600 crore per fighter jets will be bought by the government and on a total cost of 58000 crore . The taxpayers money will be  to buy such expensive jets and still the government is not answerable to them.Obviously, on a technical basis, the buy is very questionable. You can argue the pros and cons, but the cons are far more than the pros. So it becomes problematic to support such a deal.The government has failed to come up with reasonable arguments. It can impact the upcoming elections in 2019.
