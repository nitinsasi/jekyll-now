categories: humour

A rat swallowed a diamond and the owner of the diamond contracted a man to kill the rat.

When the rat hunter arrived to kill the rat there were more than a thousand rats bunched up and one sitting by itself away from the pack. He killed the one by itself and that was the exact one that had swallowed the diamond. 

The amazed owner of the diamond asked: How did you know it was that rat?

He responded: "Very easy.... * When idiots get rich they don't mix with others !!!"
