> Tattenham Corner - Jehan Numa Palace

The ambience is really good with a courteous staff. You can visit this place before 8 pm and get happy hours. They have ladies night on Thursday so girls take your squad and get 50% off on all the drinks. Saturday is a party night, it may cost you an arm and leg and you will generally find 30years + old couple. So you can give it a try but I would not recommend it. If you like beer then try the Chilled Woodpecker draught beer.

The best part about this place is they provide free and unlimited waffers.

> Under the Mango Tree  - Jehan Numa Palace

Under the mango tree is a fabulous restaurant specialising in barbeque. A very nice concept of sitting and dining under an ancient Mango Tree but now for this one has to climb the stairs. Previously one got this feel without climbing the stairs but there was no air conditioning but if we wanted air-conditioning,there are more restaurants in the same premises, so the debate goes on. The service remains as good and hospitable as always and the food delicious and served piping hot.One meal under the mango tree is a must to complete any trip to Bhopal! No Alcohol Available. Some of the best tried dishes incluse Roasted Pumpkin Parmesan Salad,Smoked Potatoe & Leek Soup ,Olive Cheese & Pumpkin Ravioli and , Greek Quesadilla.
