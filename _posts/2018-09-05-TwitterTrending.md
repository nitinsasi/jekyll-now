> What is a trend on Twitter?

A trend on Twitter refers to a hashtag-driven topic or a phrase that is immediately popular at a particular time. On Twitter's iPhone and Android apps, you can find trends by simply tapping on the search icon. When signed in to twitter.com on a desktop or laptop computer, trends are listed in many places, including the Home, Notifications, Search Results, and Profile pages.

When something trends on Twitter, it has the potential to reach millions of people. Twitter users commonly use "hashtags" to participate in trending topics. For example, during an international sports event such as the World Cup, Twitter users will append "#worldcup" to the end of their tweets to show their tweet is related to the topic. The tweet then appears as part of the feed if people click on the "#worldcup" topic on the Trends list.

A trend on Twitter refers to a hashtag-driven topic that is immediately popular at a particular time. A hashtag is a keyword or phrase that is preceded with a pound (#) sign, as with #TeachersDay or #USElections. ... It presents activity based on real-time hashtag use and not topics that have been popular for a while.

A trending topic is refreshed periodically. So, to figure at the top ten, the topic must be tweeted in a short period of time. It is necessary around 1200 tweets from 12am to 6am PDT to reach the top 10. From 6am to 12pm PDT, 1700 tweets  .  If any twitter profile with more than 30K followers is tweeting the hash tag is likely to be in Trend.

 I did some research on how Twitter's trend algorithm works, and came to the conclusion that it must meet the following conditions:

A topic that was not previously popular OR a topic that was popular before but has become popular again with a group of new people. 
It has to have no foul language in it
It has to peak in popularity within the first hour at around 500 tweets
Total tweets AND the total number of people tweeting BOTH matter. But unless there are tweets from a lot of people—what Twitter calls “widespread popularity“—total tweets will NOT matter.Let me explain this in a bit more detail. At any given time, there are probably thousands of people tweeting about Justin Bieber (I'm not a Belieber, so I could be wrong). It won't trend because it's always the same group of people tweeting about him. But if all of a sudden a large group of new people start to tweet about him, then it may trend.
