Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are in New York City, and on Tuesday they attended the US Open to watch Serena Williams play Karoline Pliskova. Both Nick and Priyanka shared photos on their Instagram accounts, in addition to videos of the match.

Priyanka and Nick were accompanied by Priyanka’s mother, Madhu Chopra, and Nick’s brother, Joe Jonas and Joe’s fiance, actor Sophie Tuner.

Previously, Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas had no qualms making out in the stands of the U.S. Open to troll photographers. But the two were remarkably less PDAy in the presence of their fellow engaged, double date companions last night, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas. Maybe they wanted to let Chonas have the full handsy spotlight; maybe they were just worn out from the last couple days; or maybe they wanted to be respectful because Priyanka's mom Madhu was also there (along with Joe's ex Gigi Hadid though that matters less). Here the couples sit together.
