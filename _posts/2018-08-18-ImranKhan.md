  Mr. Khan, who described Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah as his hero, has promised to transform corruption affected Pakistan into an Islamic Welfare state.

Imran Khan was sworn in as Pakistan’s new prime minister on Saturday, nearly 22 years after the former cricket hero entered politics.

Mr. Khan (65), the chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was administered the oath of office by President Mamnoon Hussain at a simple ceremony held at the Aiwan-e-Sadr (the President House) in Islamabad.

The ceremony commenced with the national anthem, followed by recitation of verses from the Holy Quran.
