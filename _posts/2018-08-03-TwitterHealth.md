title:  Twitter hires researchers to study the 'health' of its 'discourse'

 Twitter has hired researchers to examine the health of conversations on its platform.

One group of researchers will focus on echo chambers and uncivil discourse, while another will focus on how to bridge gaps between communities on Twitter.

In March, CEO Jack Dorsey asked for proposals -- on Twitter, of course -- from experts on how to size up the platform's health.

"Health" has been a buzz word at the company lately. In its second quarter earnings report last week, the company attributed a dip in monthly users in part to "decisions we have made to prioritize the health of the platform." The company cracked down on fake accounts, purged suspicious accounts from users' follower metrics and removed apps last quarter that violated its policies.

Twitter has long been criticized for focusing on removing content in its whack-a-mole system for dealing with abuse and removing content. It has struggled with how to moderate its platform without infringing on freedom of speech.

Dorsey conceded in March that the company's existing approach needed to be rethought, adding that Twitter didn't "fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences" of such a popular platform.

His goal, he said, is to use a "rigorous and independently vetted set of metrics" to gauge the platform's health. He plans to share the results of those metrics publicly.
