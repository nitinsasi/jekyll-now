> Updated  Former Prime Minister & Bharat Ratna #AtalBihariVaajpayee passes away in AIIMS. He was 93.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Wednesday evening to see veteran politician and former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The 93-year-old BJP leader has been on life support for the last couple of days.Atal Ji was admitted with a complaint of severe urine problem. He is suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s disease and hence it was Ranjan who noticed pale yellow urine. He doubted that there is little bit of blood in the urine. The test was done and doctors found not only a case of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), but also serious issues with his kidney.

At this moment, let us pray for our beloved former Prime Minister. May God give him strength to survive the current health problems he is bearing with.
