Scammers are everyday devising new devious way to trick you. A new cyber crime racket is currently under investigation that involves a fake SMS supposedly from Income Tax department. The crime was reported a month ago when the deadline for I-T return was nearing. People across the country started receiving these fake messages faking to be from I-T department.

According to The Hindu report, the message tells the target that their income tax refund has been approved followed by a wrong bank account number. Message asks the person to check if the account number is correct and if not then visit the link in the message to rectify it.

The account is wrong so many end up click on the website link. Clicking on the link opens a website similar to the I-T department. They are then asked to enter login ID and password which can be created on the actual I-T department website. In the next step it asks you to enter your bank account details which can be easily accessed by these cyber criminals.

"Using the same details, fraudsters can call up unsuspecting citizens posing as I-T officials and cheat them out of money by convincing them that there have been 'irregularities' in their I-T returns and they need to pay fines. This scam does not even need to be perpetrated by the original scamsters. They can simply sell the data in bulk to gangs involved in such activities, which happens quite often on the dark net. Last year, a similar scam was busted by the Thane police, where Indians accused were cheating citizens of the U.S. by posing as officials of the Internal Revenue Service," Balsing Rajput, Superintendent of Police, Maharashtra Cyber Crime was quoted by The Hindu.

Using your login details of I-T department website, scammers can transfer your I-T funds into his or her own account of change your details like your phone number or mail ID in the I-T department records.
