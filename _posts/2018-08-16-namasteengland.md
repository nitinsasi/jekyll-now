Arjun Kapoor and Parineeti Chopra's upcoming film 'Namaste England' was forced to release a new poster after it received flak over showing a wrong map of India. The earlier version of the film's poster had the Aksai Chin region of Jammu & Kashmir missing from the country's map. The romantic comedy film is slated to release on October 19.

 
The previous poster of the film featured a distorted map of India. The Aksai Chin region of Jammu & Kashmir was missing from the map. Now, the makers have released a new poster with the corrected map of the country. Parineeti shared the poster on Twitter without any mention of the mistake occurred by the team.
