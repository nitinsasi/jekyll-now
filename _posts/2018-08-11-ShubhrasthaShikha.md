Shubhrastha Shikha has emerged as a master election strategist along with Prashant Kishore and Rajat Sethi. She has worked with Prashant Kishore team before 2014 General Election, when PK was working with Narendra Modi. She was also among the core member of the team which worked for Nitish Kumar. However, she couldn't continue to work with PK for long because of his proximity with Congress leaders. She was asked by Rajat Sethi to join a small team led by Ram Madhav. The first success for this team was in Assam. Since then, this team has guided BJP to sweep almost entire North East.

Profile of Shubhrastha Shikha
Shubhrastha Shikha is a gifted young girl endowed with amazing capabilities. In such a tender age she has shown scintillating prowess. No doubt, she is widely known as a master election strategist, but it should be remembered that her is truly a versatile personality.

Shubhrastha Shikha was born in 1988 in Patna and did initial school from there. She studied from St. Paul’s High School, Patna and later Army School, Danapur Cantt. Later, she shifted to Bokaro and completed schooling from prestigious Delhi Public School, Bokaro.

Then, she took admission in the Miranda House, Delhi University and completed graduation with English Literature. She had deep interest in politics, particularly development politics. Her ambition was to become a journalist during college days. She got an opportunity with The Hindu newspaper to work as an intern for around eight months. Before that, she had previously worked with All India Radio as a news reader – for two months.

In July 2013, she along with Prashant Kishore founded Citizens For Accountable Governance – CAG. It should be noted that this institution strategized Narendra Modi Prime Ministerial campaign. Shubhrastha Shikha considers it just a small pawn in the whole election strategy and work. She said that it is wrong on the part of media to give so much credence to election strategists. After Assam Election, she humbly put that the result was because of RSS pracharaks and general BJP karyakartas. She or Rajat Sethi or other team members just coordinated the effort. This is different from the thinking of Prashant Kishore who wanted to take entire credit of Narendra Modi impressive performance in the Lok Sabha Election and that was the reason why he was asked to go out of the fold of the BJP.

Shubhrastha Shikha is also working with many media organizations as a freelance journalist, like The Guardian of London and DailyO of India Today group. Her thinking about different facets of election strategy is magnificent and a treat for readers.

Husband of Shubhrastha Shikha
Shubhra has married her boss Rajat Sethi. They started to date while working together in Assam Election. They got married before Tripura Election. Needless to say, they have become the power couple in the world of managing election. This power couple has already surpassed the reach and success of Prashant Kishore.
