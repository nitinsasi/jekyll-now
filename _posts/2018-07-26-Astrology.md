title: What are some scientific logic behind astrology?
---
Yes it does impact every aspect of human life. We should try to know whether astrology is science or not?


What is science ? Science is “the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.”

Astrology is science as it’s based on observations and experiments by our Rishis collected in various texts. Only thing it lacks in proper documentation of experiments as all the text books on astrology mention conclusions with finality without any reference to any experiment. Whatever written in the textbooks is based on penetrating observations of our Rishis.

Even if we discard this let us apply our commonsens and reason on following:-

We are tiny organism of the whole universe. So called science knows much less what affects human lives and in what manner. Scientifically we know how sun and moon affect environment and day today human life. This knowledge is broadly confined to sun and moon only we know how sun is essential for survival of human life on Earth or how gravitational pull of moon causes tides in the seawater. We don’t have any scientific study how Jupiter, Venus, mercury, Mars or Saturn affect our lives and how the position of these planets at the time of birth affect natives life.

According to Hindu astrology moon is the planet of Man(mind or brain). Our brain float in cerebral fluid. When moon causes tides as high as 100meters in the sea it’s gravitational pull also affect human brain which floats in water, that’s why moon has important position in Hindu astrology,Rashi occupied by moon becomes the Rashi of the native and Rashi becomes the important factor to make predictions.

In astrology Sun represents the life force i.e. Atma, self ,personality,authority,ability to lead. Scientifically also it’s sun which shapes personalities on earth. In various geographical regions it’s sun which decides colour, height and physical structure of natives of a particular region. It clearly manifests that astrological principles are based on scientific observations.

As science fails astrology also fails at times. It should not render whole astrology as unscientific.

Astrology plays significant role in shaping the life of an individual, I have experienced it through out my life and absolutely firm on my views.
