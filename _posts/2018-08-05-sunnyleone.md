Sunny Leone is currently gearing up to make her full-fledged debut in Tamil cinema. However, she is yet to venture into Malayalam cinema. According to reports, she is all set to make her Mollywood debut in Omar Lulu's next project.

Sunny is currently riding on the success of her biographical web-series titled Karenjit Kaur- The Untold Story of Sunny Leone.

Director Omar Lulu is known for his upcoming film Oru Adaar Love, which rose to nationwide fame because of Priya Prakash Varrier and her now-famous wink.

The filmmaker initially planned to rope in former adult star Mia Khalifa, but Sunny was eventually finalised for the role. However, no official confirmation has been made about the same.

The film already has actors like Jayaram, Dharmajan Bolghatty, Honeyrose and Vinay Forrt in vital roles.
