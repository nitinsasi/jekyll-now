title: Reddit down; Site OFFLINE as Error Code 503 message confirms CDN problems 
categories:  tech

Reddit is down for many users as people looking to use the site are being greeted by an error message.

Users trying to log on to the site are being greeted with: "Our CDN was unable to reach our servers".

The site urges anyone being greeted with a crushed Snoo piled under a ton of upvotes to "please check www.redditstatus.com if you consistently get this error."

However, the site in question simply says 'All Systems Operational' - even though independent site DownDetector.com has collected over 2000 reports of the site being offline.
