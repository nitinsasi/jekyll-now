 Former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan died on Saturday. He was 80.

An official statement from The Kofi Annan Foundation was shared on Mr. Annan’s Twitter handle: “It is with immense sadness that the Annan family and the Kofi Annan Foundation announce that Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate, passed away peacefully on Saturday 18th August after a short illness.”

The Nobel Peace Prize winner served as the U.N. special envoy to Syria, and was the first black African to be appointed as Secretary-General. He served two terms in the post from 1996-2006.

In 2016, Mr. Annan was named by the Myanmar government to head a panel to find “lasting solutions” to the conflict in Rakhine state, where human rights groups have documented widespread abuses against the minority Rohingya Muslims.
