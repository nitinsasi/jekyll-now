Slamming the final draft of Assam's National Register of Citizens (NRC), West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said she was surprised to see that the names of former President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed's family members are not on the list. She also claimed that the 40 lakh people excluded from the draft were being made refugees in their country.
