title: Manto trailer- Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nandita Das explore the life of Saadat Hasan Manto
categories:  entertainment

Manto is a biopic of the Urdu short story writer Saadat Hasan Manto, who chronicled the rigours of India's struggle for Independence and the horrors of Partition. His writings are stark in their chronicling and they often led to him being tried for indecency. From the trailer, it seems that Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who plays Manto in the film, has managed to grasp the essence of the writer's thought processes. The cast around him - Rishi Kapoor, Rasika Dugal and even Javed Akhtar - serve to emphasise the troubled times and Manto's role in history.

All Manto wanted to do was write about the events happening around him. Das' Manto tries to show how he did it and to what extent he succeeded. The film, in which Rasika plays the role of Manto's wife, will release on September 21.
