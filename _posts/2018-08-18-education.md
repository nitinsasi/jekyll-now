title:  Dear HIRING Manager, when you INTERVIEW a candidate - Remember these 5 things
categories:  education
---

1. Respect is a two-way street.  Please respect candidates time and donâ€™t keep them waiting.
2. If you know a candidate is not what you want, stop wasting their time with multiple interviews and tests. Only to get their hopes up. Have a heart!
3. Candidates invest so much time & effort, and even finances into preparing for interviews. The least you could do is read their resume and come to the interview prepared.
4. Once a candidate gives of their time to be interviewed. They deserve feedback. Stop leaving candidates hanging. Grant them closure. 
5. Treat candidates as you would like to be treated. Don't judge a book by its cover. Life is unpredictable. The person you reject today, you may need their help tomorrow. 

It annoys me at the lack of respect and empathy, some recruiters and hiring managers show to jobseekers. It's time we make the recruiting process more humane!
