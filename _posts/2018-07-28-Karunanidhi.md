title: DMK Chief M Karunanidhi supporters crowd outside Kauvery Hospital
---
CHENNAI: As the crowd outside [Kauvery Hospital][1], where [DMK][2] chief [M Karunanidhi][2] has been admitted, continued to swell, [traffic][3] on the usually bristling [TTK Road][4] here came to a standstill on Saturday. 

While at least 10 traffic policemen and a battery of other cops tried to control the crowd, patients, attenders and hospital staff had to struggle to get in. A narrow stretch paved with broken stones, between a transformer and the compound wall, is the only route they had to get in.
