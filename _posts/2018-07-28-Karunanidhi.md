title: DMK Chief M Karunanidhi supporters crowd outside Kauvery Hospital
---
CHENNAI: As the crowd outside  Kauvery Hospital , where  DMK  chief  M Karunanidhi  has been admitted, continued to swell,  traffic  on the usually bristling  TTK Road  here came to a standstill on Saturday. 

While at least 10 traffic policemen and a battery of other cops tried to control the crowd, patients, attenders and hospital staff had to struggle to get in. A narrow stretch paved with broken stones, between a transformer and the compound wall, is the only route they had to get in.
