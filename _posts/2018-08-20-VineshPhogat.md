 Vinesh Phogat on Monday created history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to win a gold medal at the Asian Games, brushing aside her rivals with remarkable ease in the 50kg category here.

Vinesh was a medal-favourite in her category and was likely to face stiff competition from Japanâ€™s Yuki Irie whom she outplayed 6-2 in the final.

It is surely a ground-breaking achievement for the 23-year-old firebrand Haryana wrestler, who is connected to Dangal-famed Phogat family.Vinesh had earlier won a bronze medal in the 48kg category at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games.

Vinesh also won back-to-back gold medals in Glasgow and Gold Coast Commonwealth Games this year.

Earlier, Sakshi Malik paid the price for being over-defensive and was left to fight for bronze in the 62kg category.

CWG silver medallist Pooja Dhanda will also fight for bronze after losing her semifinal in the 57kg.
