Pakistan’s to-be prime minister Imran Khan has decided against inviting foreign leaders and celebrities to his swearing-in ceremony as he wants to keep the event simple, a media report said Thursday—seemingly putting a lid on speculation that PM Narendra Modi could be invited to Pakistan. The oath taking ceremony is slated for 11 August and speculation was rife that this could provide the opening for the two countries to thaw ties given the possible presence of Modi at the event.
