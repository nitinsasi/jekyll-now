> Six intelligent crows have been trained to pick up litter at a theme park in France "to show that nature itself can teach us to take care of the environment."


A theme park in France is set to deploy six "intelligent" birds to pick up rubbish and spruce up the grounds.

The rooks at the Puy du Fou theme park in the west of the country have been taught to collect cigarette ends and other small bits of rubbish.

They then deposit the litter into a small box which will deliver some bird food as a reward for their hard work.

The first feathery cleaners have already been put to work, with the rest set to join them on Monday.
