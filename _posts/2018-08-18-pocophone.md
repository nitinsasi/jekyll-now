 Xiaomi’s upcoming sub-brand Pocophone will launch its Poco F1 device in India on August 22. Now it looks like the Poco F1 will be Flipkart exclusive. Flipkart’s mobile app is showing a banner for the Poco F1, though it does not specifically mention the device. However, given the similarity in the promotional material of the Poco F1 and the banner on Flipkart, its safe to assume this will launch on the e-commerce platform.

For those who are not aware, Pocophone will be a sub-brand of Xiaomi, and Poco F1 will be the first flagship phone. Poco is focusing on speed and performance when it comes to the device. Pocophone has hinted that the phone will come with the flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, and a leaked unboxing video has also hinted at something similar.

According to leaks, Poco F1 will have a 6.1-inch FHD+ display, 6GB or 8GB RAM coupled with 64GB or 128GB or 256GB storage space. It will support a dual-rear camera as well with 12MP+5MP combination, a 20MP front camera and a big 4000 mAh battery
