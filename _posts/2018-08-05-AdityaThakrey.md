Aditya Thackeracy is the son of Uddhav Thackeray, the President of Shiv Sena. It is widely believed in Maharashtra that Aditya Thackeray has the potential to keep the legacy of Bala Saheb Thackeray intact. In fact, the way he managed student politics and brought thousands of young volunteers to Shiv Sena with the help of Yuva Sena is praise worthy. In such a small age Aditya Thackeray has shown impeccable maturity in taking political decision. He is Shiv Sena’s answer to MNS Raj Thackeray.

It was Aditya Thackeray who persuaded Uddhav Thackeray to become the chief ministerial candidate of Shiv Sena – BJP alliance. The father son duo tried their best to strike a deal with the BJP. However, it was their stubbornness which led to the breaking the alliance. Aditya is taking a calculated risk. He doesn’t want to see Shiv Sena as Number 2 in Maharashtra NDA unit. The risk has obviously backfired.
