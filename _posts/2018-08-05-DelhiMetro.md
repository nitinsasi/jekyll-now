The Lajpat Nagar-Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus corridor of **Delhi** Metro’s Pink Line was flagged off by Union Minister Hardeep Puri and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday.

Speaking at the event, Mr. Puri said that it was unlikely that there will be a fare hike in 2019 as the ridership was increasing.

“The ridership is increasing and the projection for Phase 3, once it’s fully operational, is 39 lakhs. The average for the last 20 days has been 28 lakhs. With an increasing ridership, the revenue is also increasing and hence we might not have to hike fares,” said Mr. Puri.

Mr. Puri further added that a proposal to provide concessional passes for students and senior citizens will be considered.

Mr. Kejriwal said, “With the current section, the Delhi Metro network is now expanded to over 296 kilometres. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has provided comfortable and green transport to the people of Delhi.”

The 8.1 kilometre long stretch, which is a part of the Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar line, has six stations and two interchange stations at INA (Yellow Line) and Lajpat Nagar (Violet Line).
