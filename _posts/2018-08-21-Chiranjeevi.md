The movie is a period drama based on the life of Telugu freedom fighter Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy, who rebelled against the British rule 10 years before the First War of Independence in 1857.

The teaser tells the story of the unsung hero's struggle during India's first civil rebellion against the British rule around 1800.

Chiranjeevi will be seen playing the titular role.

With tilak on his forehad, long hair, beard, twirled moustache and heavy armour, Chiranjeevi looks convincing with his fierce expressions as he propels his army and takes on the Britishers on a horse with a sword.

The film, which is directed by Surender Reddy, also stars Nayanthara and Amitabh Bachchan.
