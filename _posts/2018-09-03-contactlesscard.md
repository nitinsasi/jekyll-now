Contactless debit cards have become popular in many parts of the world, and even though India got this technology two years ago, consumers haven’t really warmed up to it. However, the likes of Visa and Mastercard are at the forefront of changing this scenario, with experts confident that NFC-based card payments are the future.It’s not like there’s dearth of places where you can pay with these cards, but the basic issue is educating the customer and also the seller as often both aren’t aware of the feature.

Visa has been doing its best to market the technology and show its effectiveness with its own set of products. It believes India’s time for contactless card (CC) payments has arrived.
