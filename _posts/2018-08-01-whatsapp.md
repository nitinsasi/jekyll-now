 Instant messaging application Whatsapp has rolled out a new feature, allowing users to make group voice calls as well as video calls.

“Over the last couple of years, people have enjoyed making voice and video calls on WhatsApp. In fact, our users spend over 2 billion minutes on calls per day,” the Facebook-owned firm said in a blog. It added that up to four users can be part of a group call. “Start a one-on-one voice or video call and tap the new ‘add participant’ button in the top right corner to add more contacts to the call.”

The feature is available on the iPhone and Android versions of the app.
