title: Maratha quota stir,Ignoring procedure to resign highlights political posturing 
---
When seven legislators from one State Legislative Assembly resign over a period of two days, it's big news, especially when it was done in support of the Maratha quota stir or the way the government handled it.

A significant aspect of their resignation is the fact that they do not belong to a single party. Of the seven legislators who resigned, two — Seema Hire and Rahul Ahir — are from the BJP, three — Dattatray Bharne, Ramesh Kadam, and Jaidev Chikatgaonkar — belong to the Nationalist Congress Party, one legislator Bharat Bhalke is from the Congress, and one legislator Harshvardhan Jadhav is from the Shiv Sena, which is part of the BJP-led ruling coalition at the State as well as the Centre.
