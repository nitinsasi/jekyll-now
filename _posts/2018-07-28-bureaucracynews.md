 BHOPAL: Former IAS couple Arvind Joshi and Tinoo Joshi have been sent to prison in connection with a money laundering case after they surrendered before a court in Bhopal.
Judge Alok Awasthi of the special court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) sent the Joshis in judicial custody last evening.

The court granted bail to Arvind Joshi's parents--Nirmala Joshi, 88 and H M Joshi, 92 -against a surety of Rs. 50,000 each in view of their old age, said an Enforcement Directorate (ED) official.

Joshi's parents are co-accused in the case.

The court had issued a warrant against the accused on July 19 in connection with a case filed by the ED under the PMLA.


Arvind and Tinoo, both IAS officers, were dismissed from service in 2014 for allegedly amassing wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income.

During a raid at their house in Bhopal in 2010, the Income Tax officials allegedly found Rs. 3.03 crore in cash. The Madhya Pradesh Lokayukta Police also filed a separate case against the couple for allegedly amassing assets worth a whopping Rs. 41.87 crore.

The couple has not been convicted in these cases yet.

### Seven IAS officers shifted

Calcutta: The state government on Monday transferred seven senior IAS officers, a move considered to be the last major change in the bureaucracy before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Rajiva Sinha, a 1986 batch IAS officer who was secretary in charge of the micro, small and medium enterprises department, has been transferred to the health department. Transport secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, a 1987 batch officer, replaces Sinha.

"Sinha and Bandyopadhyay are two of the senior-most officers in Bengal now. They have been given bigger responsibilities. While Sinha will have to streamline the health department, which was at the centre of controversies over the past few weeks, Bandyopadhyay will have to organise the conclave of micro, small and medium enterprises, to be held later this year," an official at Nabanna said.

Animal resources development secretary B.P. Gopalika, a 1989 batch officer, is the new transport secretary. Verma, also a 1989 batch officer, replaces Gopalika.
