 According to TOI report MP pooll incharge , Babaria is manhandled by congress workers after he announced CM face for Madhya Pradesh.
 He was addressing a press conference at the Rewa circuit house when he was asked who would be chief minister if Congress came to power. The AICC general secretary said it would probably be Jyotiraditya Scindia or Kamal Nath, sources said. Asked if Leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh, who is influential in the Rewa-Satna-Sidhi region, is also on the list, Babaria replied: “Whatever you understand.”

 After the press meet, when Babaria went into a room in the circuit house, a group of Congress workers barged in and allegedly roughed him up. Babaria was rescued by another group of Congress workers. 
 
 PCC chief Kamal Nath, election campaign committee chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Ajay Singh and Babaria have been called to meet Rahul at 10 am on Tuesday.
