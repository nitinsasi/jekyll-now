He was the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, in Nitish Kumar government for twenty months.Yadav is the second eldest son of the former chief ministers of Bihar Lalu Prasad Yadav & Rabri Devi. The Jantar Mantar protest has given mileage to his political career.  12 parties hold hands at Jantar Mantar; ‘As you see, Opposition stands united’ . With the sexual abuse cases at a shelter home in Muzaffarpur, in NDA-governed Bihar, as the pivot, the event was organised by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) at Jantar Mantar, the ‘protest venue’ in the national capital. Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal was also present at the event. 
Theoretically a united opposition can defeat the BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The combined vote share is higher than that of the BJP. Therefore Tejasvi is considered as a potential opponent for BJP in Bihar.

Educational qualification

He studied until 9th class from DPS PATNA. He dropped out of school without completing his school education. He has been criticised by the opposition leaders for becoming Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar despite being a school drop-out; not a good sign for a state with lowest literacy rate in the country


Corruption case

The Central Bureau of Investigation registered a case of corruption against Mr Yadav, his father Lalu Prasad, his brother Tej Pratap Yadav, his mother Rabri Devi and several other members of the family on July 5, 2017. On July 27, the Enforcement Directorate registered another criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar asked Tejashwi to resolve the matter or resign. The latter did neither, following which Nitish Kumar resigned, breaking the nascent coalition with RJD and going back to the old ally BJP, which was in the Opposition at the time, to form yet another coalition government.
