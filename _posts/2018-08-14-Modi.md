 The PM Modi-led government, which is known for its wide outreach on social media, is set to achieve another feat as 'tech-savvy millennials'. In a first-of-its-kind digital drive, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech, delivered from the ramparts of the Red Fort, will be live streamed on Google and YouTube.

To ensure that maximum number of people watch Modi's last speech as prime minister in his present term, public broadcaster Prasar Bharati has tied up with the web search engine and the video-sharing website to telecast the I-Day programme live online.
