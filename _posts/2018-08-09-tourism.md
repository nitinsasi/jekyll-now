The tourism ministry of India has roped in Google to showcase 3D rotating views and a virtual reality experience of Indian monuments on its Incredible India website.

KJ Alphons, Tourism Minister, said, “We want to give tourists a virtual reality experience, and Google has the technology and the product. We hope this will inspire more people to come to India”.

The ministry has requested all states to set up specialised police teams to protect foreign tourists.

Currently, 14 states and Union Territories including Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka and Kerala have the provision of tourist police.

Earlier, in April, Google Arts & Culture had partnered with the Ministry of Tourism to unveil a 360-degree virtual reality video for the global ‘Incredible India’ tourism campaign.

With the evolution of tech-enabled startups and newer concepts like staycation, adventure tourism, ecotourism, medical tourism and pilgrimage tourism across the country the industry is on the cusp of potential growth.
