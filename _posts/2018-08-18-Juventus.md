 Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo is set to make his Serie A debut following his $117m move from Real Madrid to Italian giants Juventus.

Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri confirmed Ronaldo will be in the starting line-up for the reigning champions' league opener against Chievo on Saturday.

"Ronaldo is playing tomorrow," Allegri told a news conference in Turin before the match.

"He is settling in well and he's a simple lad to deal with. It's only natural that the more we play together, the better things will get, and this will only benefit the team.

"However, we must not think that just because we've got Ronaldo, we'll win. We still need to prove that Juventus are technically better now."

Following the move to Italy, the 33-year-old, who scored 451 goals in 438 games for Real, has shown no signs of resting on his laurels.

"I am going to prove that I am a top player," said Ronaldo. "I am very ambitious and I like challenges."

Ronaldo joined Real in 2009 from English side Manchester United and won two Spanish titles and four Champions Leagues with the club in addition to a host of individual awards.

But he hinted his time at the Santiago Bernabeu could be up immediately after the last Champions League success and Juventus captured his signature.
