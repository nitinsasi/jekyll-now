A man was shot dead today by security forces after he rammed his car into the home of National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah in Jammu. Mr Abdullah, a Z-plus category protectee, was not at home when the incident took place. One security official was injured.
Police said the unarmed man drove a black Mahindra XUV500 at a high speed, banged the car against the main gate and drove in. He started vandalising the property after he crashing in.
CRPF personnel shot him dead near the stairs that led to the bedrooms.


@OmarAbdullah tweeted - I am aware of the incident that took place at the residence my father & I share in Bhatindi, Jammu. Details are sketchy at the moment. Initial reports suggest an intruder was able to gain entry through the front door & in to the upper lobby of the house.
