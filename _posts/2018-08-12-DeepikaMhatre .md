categories:  women

Deepika Mhatre went from cleaning houses to performing at comedy clubs, delivering commentaries on the discrimination that domestic workers face.

She worked as a domestic help for several years and is now using that experience to talk about the discrimination that helps face, working for the urban rich. She is funny and intelligent, say hello to Deepika Mhatre.Simantini Dey added,

On stage, a matronly figure in a salwar kameez and dupatta – a long scarf – with her long hair tied back, she tells the audience she is special. So special that in the building where she works, she says, they have installed a special lift just for her. She pauses. In the homes where she works, they even have special plates and glasses just for her, she says.

It takes a second or two before the audience understands that she is satirising the habit across India of forcing domestic staff – maids, cooks, nannies and drivers – to use separate elevators so they don’t “pollute” the lifts used by the rich residents, and to eat off separate plates.
