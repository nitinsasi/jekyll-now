New Delhi; After Kerala Chief Minister said that the talks are underway about accepting foreign governments’ donations, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement saying that it appreciates offers from several countries, however, in line with the “existing policy”, government is committed to meeting requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts. The MEA said, “GoI deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods (in Kerala).”

In response to queries regarding media reports on international assistance for flood relief measures, the MEA Official Spokesperson said:


 “In line with existing policy, the government is committed to meeting requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts. Contributions to PM Relief Fund and CM Relief Fund from NRIs, PIOs and international entities such as foundations would, however, be welcome,” the statement added.
 
 
​The Kerala government earlier today said that it would approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clear hurdles in getting the Rs 700 crore relief aid offered by UAE. Vijayan also said that UAE cannot be considered "any other nation" as Keralites have contributed immensely in their nation-building.
