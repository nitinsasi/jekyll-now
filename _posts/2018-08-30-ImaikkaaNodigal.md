Nayanthara starrer Imaikkaa Nodigal is all set to hit the silver screens. It is one of the most anticipated films of the year. Director R. Ajay Gnanamuthu recently revealed an interesting information about the film which will surely surprise you. He stated that the actress was chosen over veteran actor Mammootty for the lead role along with giving a perfect justification for it.

Apparently, Mammootty was approached to play the lead in 2014 and he even agreed to do it. However, after the script was modified over time, makers felt that the female lead can uplift the movie and this is how Nayanthara came onboard. The filmmaker further said that the character could be lifted to another emotional level with the female lead.

The movie is in the limelight for reasons more than one. Imaikkaa Nodigal marks the Tamil debut of Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap. He will apparently be seen as a psychopath killer whereas the actress plays a CBI officer, who goes after him.

Apart from Kashyap and Nayanthara, the film also features Raashi Khanna and Atharvaa in crucial roles.
