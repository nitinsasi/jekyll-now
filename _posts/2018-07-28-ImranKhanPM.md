The world is getting ready to greet Sportsman turned Politician Imran Khan as the next Prime Minister of Pakistan.Pakistan is looking for a new leadership under Imran Khan. It is a country  where politicians are corrupt and people need a new face. International media use to say that Azif Ali Zardari use to take 10% cut on all deals during Benazir Bhutto's leadership. Questions are being asked if Imran Khan is the Arvind Kejriwal of Pakistan.Positioning himself as an honest crusader against corruption, Khan had even said that he was an outsider like Arvind Kejriwal. To his credit, he created a party from nowhere and challenged Pakistan’s deeply entrenched ‘establishment’.

It was easy for some to see the PTI as a prototype of the AAP here in India.   It is said that Imran Khan won the seats with Pakistan Army's help but let me tell our readesr that he is into politics from 20 years.The youth envisions a corruption free new Pakistan and twitter is loaded with hashtag #nayapakistan. Imran Khan also want to take a stand on American drone attacks on Pakistan. He comes with a sports man spirit, He made his party Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in Pakistan in 1996.Today, the PTI has swept the election in Pakistan and Imran Khan is set to be the prime minister.There are already serious allegations that the army has rigged the 2018 elections in favour of Khan, and that the Supreme Court and the Election Commission contributed.   

 Despite his Oxford-education, Imran Khan has collaborated with obscurantist forces and religious fanatics to win. He has rubbished feminism as a Western concept, supported blasphemy law, favoured the continuance of the second amendment that declares Ahmadiyya as un-Islamic, flirted with the Taliban, asked for support from extremist elements like the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan and the anti-Shia Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat. His proximity to the Taliban was so pronounced that he was once called Taliban Khan.
 
The great @ImranKhanPTI led his country to the top of the Cricket World in 1992. Now he has an opportunity to champion his country's cause with his leadership. The world awaits. Pakistani people has given him a chance.

The below picture was posted on twitter today. This definitely has nothing to do with his Prime ministership.
