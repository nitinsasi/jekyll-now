A district collector in Kerala has set an example in handling cyber bullies, asking schoolchildren and parents pestering her to declare rain holidays to instead pit their creativity against the root cause of extreme rain- climate change.

Thiruvananthapuram collector K. Vasuki's Facebook response has won her appreciation from hundreds, changing the mood of the comments that had never been abusive but often bordered on derision.

"I invite all of you to offer your skills, energy, dedication and wonderful creativity voluntarily to the C power 5 - Change Can Change Climate Change initiative, which aims to create a sustainable lifestyle to (meet) the climate change challenges. Better late than never," she wrote on Friday night.

Vasuki was referring to the state government's Project C5, launched in April to control climate change by involving the state's people.Over the past month, it had become a sport for Kerala schoolchildren to use social media to beseech, badger and bully collectors to declare rain holidays as some of their peers had already done. The posts' tone often ranged from irreverent to insolent.

Ernakulam collector K. Muhammad Y. Safirulla was mockingly patted as "lion of the revolution" for declaring a rain holiday. One poster egged him on to "enter (the) inbox" of a fellow collector who had not granted a holiday, "make fun of" her and ask her why she was "so devoid of mercy".

Vasuki was urged not "to belittle herself before the other collectors" by failing to announce a holiday. "Hey sister, Thiruvananthapuram is flooded. Can't you help by giving a holiday?" said another poster.

Vasuki began by thanking all those who had commented on her page, emphasising that it was a platform for the public to share their views. She then shifted the focus to a larger issue."I hope you are familiar with climate change and its impact... the ones like (Cyclone) Ockhi.... It brought back a ton of plastic and other wastes back to the land in a single night," Vasuki wrote.

The collector had slogged day and night when Ockhi hit last year, killing at least 47 people on land and sea, with 188 fishermen reported missing.

"Extremes in rainfall distribution and their unpredictability are going to keep on increasing in the coming future because of climate change," Vasuki wrote.

"But if your boundless energy and fresh talents are channelled to reverse the climate change trends, you will not only save yourselves from future misery but also save the entire world from it."

Earlier, responding to the requests, Vasuki had declared Tuesday as a holiday although some parents still complained they had learnt of it only after braving the weather and taking their children to school.

Appreciation for her latest post poured in on Saturday.

"We have a collector with a vision. Very happy," wrote Sajeev Parameshwaran Nair.

"Feeling proud to have a leader like you for (the) district, ma'am," wrote a student, Nihitha Praseed.

Vasuki's husband S. Karthikeyan, collector of neighbouring Kollam, too has received messages from children seeking rain holidays.

The IAS couple are doctors who had met in medical college before deciding to join the civil service. Vasuki is a 2008-batch Madhya Pradesh-cadre officer while Karthikeyan is from the 2011-batch Kerala cadre.

Vasuki, an accomplished Bharatanatyam dancer, painter and singer, has been an enthusiastic campaigner for the environment.
