Private coaching centres charge a huge sum for preparing students for entrance exams like IIT-JEE, NEET, and UGC-NET. But now the government is planning to coach students for free.  

  [Times of India reports](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/free-govt-coaching-for-jee-neet-from-2019/articleshow/65600522.cms). The National Testing Agency – which conducts exams for admission to higher educational institutes – will use its 2,700-odd centres to offer mock tests and preparation classes. The move could be a body blow to India's [over $40 billion private coaching industry](https://theprint.in/governance/govt-to-make-competitive-exams-easy-to-sideline-private-coaching-industry/79742/), which is often blamed for the [poor quality of students](https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/coaching-factories-are-dumbing-down-the-iits/234521), but some experts feel coaching centres [keep students engaged](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/in-volte-face-iit-directors-say-coaching-not-bad/articleshow/65556009.cms) in ‘constructive’ activities.
  
  The scheme would immensely help those from rural areas. As per the plan, candidates will first be allowed to take mock tests for these exams this year, while teaching sessions will start next year.

Those who wish to avail the free mock test facility will have to register on NTA's mobile app or website, which will be launched on September 1. Students can register for these sessions at their nearest test centre till September 30. They can choose test slots at nearest centres in their area.
