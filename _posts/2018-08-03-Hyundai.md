South Korean auto major Hyundai plans to launch an electric SUV in India next year as it prepares to test the country's Electric Vehicle (EV) market before going full throttle with local manufacturing for such vehicles, a top company executive said. The company, which operates in India through a wholly-owned subsidiary, plans to bring the vehicle as a completely knocked down (CKD) unit.

"We will launch an electric SUV in the second half of 2019. We will import it as a completely knocked down unit," Hyundai Motor India MD and CEO YK Koo said. In the long term the company will produce EV models from its Chennai plant, he added. Koo said the company's strategy for EVs is in line with the government's vision of making India an EV market by 2020. However, he sought more liberal policies on taxation for the EV segment in the country.

When asked if the company could look at collaboration with Kia Motors for the vertical, Koo said "Many items are required, so (with only) one party investment the cost is very high. So, if we find a good partner we can consider also."

Hyundai had showcased EV models Ioniq and Kona during the auto expo earlier this year in Delhi.
