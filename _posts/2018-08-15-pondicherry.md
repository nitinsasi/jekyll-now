Mocktails and Meditation, is what I would call Pondicherry! As different as that sounds, there’s no other place one can meet both so perfectly.Home to the famous Sri Aurobindo Ashram, the Mantri Mandir and the unique experimental community of Auroville, Pondicherry is the perfect weekend getaway for anyone looking for a quiet escape from life. Pondicherry (or Puducherry), a French colonial settlement in India until 1954, is now a Union Territory town bounded by the southeastern Tamil Nadu state. Its French legacy is preserved in its French Quarter, with tree-lined streets, mustard-colored colonial villas and chic boutiques. A seaside promenade runs along the Bay of Bengal and passes several statues, including a 4m-high Gandhi Memorial.

On the edge of Bharathi Park, the Pondicherry Museum displays carriages, stone sculptures and bronzes. Tranquil Paradise Beach lies south of town and can be reached by boat. The Sri Aurobindo Ashram, founded in 1926, is a famous spiritual center devoted to integral yoga. Some 8km north, Auroville (City of Dawn) is a utopian community showcasing the Matrimandir structure’s futuristic golden sphere. The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, an early-20th-century Catholic church, has a neo-Gothic design. An elephant provides blessings at the entrance of Manakula Vinayagar Temple.


 
Liqour is cheap here compared to other states but do not try to take bottles from here, There is strict checking at the exit tolls. Puducherry has been built by following an excellent town planning idea. The place is better known as White Town.
